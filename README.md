### My Additional Feature
The theme for this project is "Drawing on the Moon". I have seen various tools that allow users to draw in 3D space, but playing around with physics in your creation was not very popular. In my additional feature, I used enable3D to wrap a physics engine around Three.js. I allow users to create and customize their content on the Moon while giving them full control of the physics engine. 

These features can be found under "Tools" within the app and you can see how objects are effected by the Moon's gravity! You can also customize the gravity if you want to explore and compare Earth's "normal" gravity or turn it down all the way to -24.79 and see what it's like being on Jupiter! This takes drawing in 3D *space* to a whole new level, or in this case, planet!
